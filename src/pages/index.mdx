In this workshop, we’ll explore the expressive potential of text-as-material through collective, combinatory poetry.

Our entry point will be a new feature in the p5.js 2.0 release: support for variable fonts. Together, we’ll experiment with how typography, especially the dynamic capabilities of variable fonts, can shape, stretch, and animate language.

Participants will engage in beginner-friendly coding exercises and collaborative writing prompts, culminating in interactive poetic sketches that reflect the plasticity of both code and text.

_This workshop is open to all levels. No prior coding experience is necessary._
_Bring your laptop to participate._
